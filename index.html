                <h2>Hawaii</h2>
                <p>Hawaii is made up of a group of volcanic islands in the Pacific Ocean. Eight of these are considered as the main islands: Ni'hau, kaua'i, O'ahu, Moloka'i, Lana'i, Kaho'olawe, Maui, and Hawai'i (also known as the "Big Island"). Hawaii was settled by Polynesians before it was discovered by a british explorer named James Cook. It became the Kingdom of Hawai'i in the early 1800s; however, the kingdom fell by the hands of the Committee of Safety (a group of European and American businessmen) before the beginning of the next century. Hawai'i was then annexed by the United States as a U.S. territory.</p>
                <p>During World War II, Hawaii's Pearl Harbor was attacked by Japan. This led to the United States officially joining the war.</p>
                <p>Hawaii was admitted to the Union on August 21, 1959 as the 50th state of the United States of America.</p>

                The Hawaiian State Flag features a Union Jack in the top left corner with 8 stripes of white, red, and blue. This flag dates back to even before Hawaii became the 50th state in the U.S.
                <br>
                A british captain by the name of George Vancouver presented a Red Ensign, which was used by the Royal Navy, to the Hawaiian king in 1793. After 1801, the british Union Jack served as the unofficial flag of Hawaii from then until 1816, when red, white, and blue stripes were added to unite the Hawaiian islands as the Kingdom of Hawaii. After 1843, the stripes on the flag changed to eight (8) white, red, and blue stripes - one stripe for each of the main Hawaiian islands.
                <br>
                There is no official significance for the colors used in the Hawaiian flag; However, many speculate that the colors were influenced by the first foreign countries that visited Hawaii, namely Britain, the United States, and France. Another theory describes that the red is for the Hawaiian gods, white for truth, and blue for the ocean.</p>
