                <h2>Hawaii</h2>
                <p>Hawaii is made up of 137 volcanic islands. Only 8 of the 137 islandsare considered as the main islands: Ni'hau, kaua'i, O'ahu, Moloka'i, Lana'i, Kaho'olawe, Maui, and Hawai'i (also known as the "Big Island"). Hawaii was settled by Polynesians before it was discovered by a british explorer named James Cook. It was internationally recognized as the Kingdom of Hawai'i in the early 19th century; however, the kingdom fell by the hands of European and American businessmen before the beginning of the next century. Hawai'i was then annexed by the United States as a U.S. territory. </p>During World War II, Hawaii's Pearl Harbor was attacked by Japan. This led to the United States officially joining the war.</p>
                <p>Hawaii was admitted to the Union on August 21, 1959 as the 50th state of the United States of America.</p>
